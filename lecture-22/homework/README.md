# Homework: Fetch a Random Dad Joke

## Task 1

- Use the icanhazdadjoke.com API to fetch and display a random dad joke when a button is
clicked. API Endpoint: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/
- Important: For this specific API, you must send an Accept header to tell it you want a JSON response
- You are recommended to use [Lecture 21's Fetch example](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/FSD-C-WE-E-B22/blob/main/lecture-21/live-coding/fetch.html) as a reference to make an API call

### Steps
- Create a button and a div to display the joke
- When the button is clicked, fetch from the URL
- Remember to include the headers option in your fetch call
- Use the .then() chain to parse the JSON and display the joke property from the data object on your page

## Task 2

Complete the [resetForm](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/FSD-C-WE-E-B22/blob/main/lecture-22/live-coding/index.html#L244) method in the Hero & Monster Manager
