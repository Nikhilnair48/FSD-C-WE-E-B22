            A French Appeals Court has ruled that the spot where the Dutch genius Vincent van Gogh allegedly shot
            himself to death 135 years ago is private property, rejecting a claim by local government officials that it
            belongs to the public. The legal battle over the patch of land in the Auvers-sur-Oise commune on the
            northwestern outskirts of Paris had been ongoing for five years. A lower court had earlier declared the spot
            as private property.A French Appeals Court has ruled that the spot where the Dutch genius Vincent van Gogh
