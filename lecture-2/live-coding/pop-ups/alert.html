                Important to remember:
                    - Alert, Prompt and Confirm are functions; in mathematical terms, similar to f(x) = 3x
                    - A function is simply a block of code that's reusable
                    - A function can accept a variable
                    - A function can also accept another function; in mathematical terms, it's similar to f(g(x)) = 3x
                    - In programmatic terms, it means that the alert function can accept another function as input
                    - That's why the examples in lines 21 and 24 works. Relevant programming paradigm: functional programming (Lecture 2 Slide 4)
