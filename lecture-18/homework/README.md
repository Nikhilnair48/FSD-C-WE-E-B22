# Task: Mood Changer!

## Requirements
  - For the base code provided in the [index.html](https://github.com/Nikhilnair48/FSD-C-WE-E-B22/tree/main/lecture-18/homework/index.html), you need to write the functions to complete mood changer
  - Functions to complete:
      - Have at least three buttons, each representing a mood (eg: Happy, Sad, Excited)
      - A central div that displays the current mood as text (e.g., "Current Mood: Happy")
      - When a mood button is clicked:
        - The text in the central div updates to the clicked mood
        - The document.body background color changes to reflect the mood (e.g., yellow for happy, blue for sad, orange for excited)
        - (Optional) An emoji or an image related to the mood changes in another div
      - Ensure a default mood is displayed when the page loads

  - You can be creative with the implementation. Sample outcomes for inspiration:
